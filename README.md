Replace the API with pinecone.io API key for personal use
Use node (filename) to run the files in order:
index creates an index in the pinecone database
namespace sets up namespaces within that index with given data
querying queries the specified index and namespace to find the most similar data
deleteIndex deletes the index completely from pinecone database
